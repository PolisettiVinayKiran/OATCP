**Problem Explanation:**

The problem "Patching Array" involves finding the minimum number of patches required to patch a given array such that it contains all integers from 1 to n (inclusive). Initially, the array is empty, and patches can only be applied by appending elements to the array. Each patch can be any integer value that is not already present in the array.

**Explanation:**

The `min_patches` function implements a greedy approach to solve the "Patching Array" problem. It iteratively patches the array with the smallest possible integers to cover the missing elements from 1 to 'n'. 

The approach works as follows:
- It maintains a variable `cur_max`, representing the maximum reachable value using the current patches.
- It iterates through the array of integers, comparing each element with `cur_max`.
- If the current element is less than or equal to `cur_max`, it extends the range by adding the element to `cur_max`.
- If the current element is greater than `cur_max`, it doubles `cur_max` and adds a new patch.
- This process ensures that the missing integers are covered in the most efficient manner, minimizing the number of patches required.

**Greedy Approach Explanation:**

- **Identifying Greedy Approach:** In this problem, the greedy approach is used to iteratively patch the array with the smallest possible integers to cover the missing elements. The idea is to greedily select the smallest integer not present in the array that can extend the current range.
  
- **Optimization:** The greedy approach is optimized by maintaining a variable `cur_max`, which represents the maximum reachable value using the current patches. We iteratively compare `cur_max` with the next element in the array. If the next element is less than or equal to `cur_max`, we extend the range by adding it to `cur_max`. Otherwise, we double `cur_max` and add a new patch. This ensures that we cover the missing integers in the most efficient manner.
  
- **Identifying Greedy Strategy:** The problem structure suggests a greedy strategy because at each step, we want to maximize the range covered by the current patches while minimizing the number of patches used. The greedy approach here is to always extend the current range to cover as many missing integers as possible with the smallest patches.

**Input and Output:**

- The code takes input from a file, which contains a sequence of integers representing the elements of the array and the value of 'n'.
- It outputs the minimum number of patches required to patch the array such that it contains all integers from 1 to 'n'.
