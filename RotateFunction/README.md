**Problem Explanation:**

The problem "Rotate Function" involves finding the maximum value of a function `F` after performing a rotation operation on an array `arr`. The function `F` is defined as the sum of the product of each element of `arr` with its corresponding index, after rotation. The rotation operation involves shifting all elements of `arr` to the right by one position, with the last element becoming the first.

**Explanation:**

The function `get_rotate_max` calculates the maximum value of a function `F` after performing a rotation operation on an array `arr`. The function `F` is defined as the sum of the product of each element of `arr` with its corresponding index, after rotation.
The algorithm iterates through each element of the array to compute the total sum of the elements and the sum of the product of each element with its index before any rotation. These values are stored in variables `total_sum` and `prev`, respectively.
The algorithm then initializes `res` to negative infinity and updates it to the maximum of its current value and `prev`.
Next, the algorithm iterates through each element of the array in reverse order. For each element, it calculates a temporary value `temp` by subtracting the product of the last element and its index from the sum of `total_sum` and `prev`. The algorithm updates `res` to the maximum of its current value and `temp`, and updates `prev` to `temp`.
Finally, the algorithm returns the maximum value `res`.

**Dynamic Programming (DP) Explanation:**

- **Overlapping Subproblems:** In this problem, the overlapping subproblems occur when we repeatedly compute the value of the function `F` for different rotations of the array. This is because the same subproblem may be encountered multiple times during the computation.
  
- **Optimization:** Dynamic programming is not directly used in this solution. Instead, the solution optimally calculates the maximum value of the function `F` in a single pass through the array, without storing intermediate results. 
  
- **Identifying Subproblems:** The problem does not explicitly break down into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently. Instead, the solution iteratively updates the value of the function `F` for each rotation of the array, keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far.

**Input and Output:**

- The code takes input from a file, which contains the size of the array and the elements of the array.
- It outputs the maximum value of the function `F` after performing the rotation operation on the given array.
