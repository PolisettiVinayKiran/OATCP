**Problem Explanation:**

The problem "Remove K Digits" involves removing k digits from a given non-negative integer num to form the smallest possible number. The digits must be removed in such a way that the resulting number is still a valid non-negative integer.

**Explanation:**

The function remove_k_digits aims to find the smallest possible number that can be obtained by removing k digits from a given non-negative integer num. It utilizes a greedy approach to iteratively remove digits from the number while maintaining the resulting number's smallest possible value.

**Greedy Algorithm Explanation:**

- **Greedy Approach:** The problem can be solved using a greedy approach by iteratively removing digits from the number to form the smallest possible number. The basic idea is to remove a digit if it is greater than the next digit in the number, as removing it would make the resulting number smaller. This process is repeated k times to remove k digits from the number.

- **Optimization:** The greedy approach is optimized by using a stack to efficiently compare digits and remove them when necessary. The algorithm ensures that the removed digits lead to the smallest possible number by considering each digit in the input number and comparing it with the digits in the stack.

- **Identifying Greedy Approach:** The problem can be identified as a candidate for a greedy approach because the objective is to minimize the resulting number by removing digits. Greedy algorithms are often suitable for optimization problems where making locally optimal choices at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.

**Input and Output:**

- The code takes input from a file, which contains the original non-negative integer num and the value of k.
- It outputs the smallest possible number that can be obtained by removing k digits from the original number.
