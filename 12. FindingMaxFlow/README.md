**Problem Explanation:**

The problem involves finding the maximum flow in a given graph using the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm. In a flow network, each edge has a capacity, and the flow through an edge cannot exceed its capacity. The maximum flow is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source node to the sink node, satisfying the capacity constraints on the edges.

**Explanation:**

The provided algorithm implements the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to find the maximum flow in a given flow network graph. It utilizes a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find augmenting paths from the source to the sink in the residual graph, where residual capacities represent the remaining capacity of edges after flow has been sent. The BFS efficiently explores the graph to find paths with available capacity, optimizing the search process. By iteratively updating the residual capacities along augmenting paths and incrementing the maximum flow accordingly, the algorithm gradually increases the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found. This iterative process efficiently maximizes the flow through the network. Additionally, the algorithm measures and outputs the execution time to provide insights into its performance. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(V*E^2) and space complexity of O(V).

**BFS and Residual Graph Optimization Explanation:**

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** The BFS algorithm is used to find an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the residual graph. It ensures that the path found has the minimum number of edges and thus optimizes the search process.

- **Residual Graph:** The residual graph represents the remaining capacity of each edge after the flow has been sent through the graph. It allows the algorithm to backtrack and find additional augmenting paths until no more paths are available, maximizing the flow through the network.

- **Optimization:** By using BFS to find augmenting paths in the residual graph, the algorithm avoids exploring unnecessary paths and improves efficiency. Additionally, updating the residual capacities of edges along the augmenting path ensures that the flow is incrementally adjusted to maximize the overall flow from source to sink.

**Input and Output:**

- The code takes input from a file, which contains the number of nodes, the source and sink nodes, and the edges with their capacities.
- It outputs the maximum flow that can be sent from the source node to the sink node in the given graph. Additionally, it prints the execution time of the algorithm.
