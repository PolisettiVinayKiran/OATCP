**Problem Explanation:**

The problem involves maximizing the number of ice bars that can be bought given a certain amount of coins and the cost of each ice bar. The goal is to buy as many ice bars as possible without exceeding the total amount of coins available.


**Explanation:**

The function get_max_icebars iterates through the sorted array of ice bar costs and checks if each cost is less than or equal to the total number of coins available. If the cost is affordable, it deducts the cost from the total number of coins and increments the count of ice bars bought. This process continues until either all ice bars are bought or the remaining coins are insufficient to buy the next ice bar.

**Greedy Approach Explanation:**

- **Optimization:** Greedy approach is used to optimize the solution. We sort the ice bar costs in non-decreasing order, then iteratively buy ice bars starting from the cheapest until we run out of coins. This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the number of ice bars bought without exceeding the total number of coins available.

- **Identifying Greedy Approach:** The problem exhibits the property of optimal substructure, where the solution to the entire problem can be constructed from solutions to its subproblems. Additionally, the greedy choice of buying the cheapest available ice bars first is always optimal, as it allows us to buy more ice bars overall.

**Input and Output:**

- The code takes input from a file, which contains the number of ice bars, their costs, and the total number of coins available.
- It outputs the maximum number of ice bars that can be bought with the given number of coins.
