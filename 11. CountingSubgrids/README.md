**Problem Explanation:**

The problem "Counting Subgrids" involves finding the number of subgrids in an nxn grid where all four corners of the subgrid are black (1). Each square in the grid can either be black or white.

**Explanation:**

The algorithm for counting subgrids with all corners black in an nxn grid involves two main steps: preprocessing and counting. In the preprocessing step, the grid is divided into blocks of N columns each, and each row is stored as a list of K-bit numbers, where K is the block size. This is done to optimize the counting process using bitwise operations. Then, in the counting step, nested loops iterate over pairs of rows (a, b) to count the number of black corners in each subgrid. Within these loops, another loop iterates over the blocks of columns, and bitwise AND operations are used to determine the number of black corners shared by rows a and b in each block. The count of black corners is accumulated for each pair of rows, and the total count of subgrids is calculated by summing the contributions from all pairs of rows. This optimized approach significantly reduces the time complexity compared to the naive brute-force method, leading to a substantial performance improvement, especially for large grid sizes. Time complexity will be reduced to O(n^3/N) from o(n^3).

**Bit Manipulation Optimization Explanation:**

- **Identifying Bit Optimization:** Since the brute-force approach has a time complexity of O(n^3), we can optimize it using bit manipulation to reduce the complexity.

- **Optimization Technique:** In the bit optimization approach, the grid is divided into blocks of size N columns each, where N is typically a power of 2 (e.g., 32). Each row is then stored as a list of K-bit numbers (where K is the block size), and bitwise operations are used to count the number of black corners in each subgrid.

- **Performance Improvement:** By using bitwise operations, we can significantly reduce the time complexity of counting the number of black corners in each subgrid. This results in a substantial performance improvement, especially for large grid sizes.

**Input and Output:**

- The code takes input from a file, which contains the grid size (n) and the grid with black (1) and white (0) squares.
- It outputs the number of subgrids in the grid where all four corners are black.
